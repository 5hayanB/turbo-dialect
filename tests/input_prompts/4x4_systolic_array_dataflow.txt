4 bit data pass through a grid of 4 processing elements. The data traversing through the grid will be saved in a register at each level, horizontally and vertically. Each processing element will take the values from the two registers (one from the horizontal and the other from vertical register) in its level, which are then multiplied together, added with the value of an accumulator register and stored into it.
