4 4-bit inputs (2 from the left and 2 from the top) pass through a grid of 4 cells. In each cell of the grid, two registers store the incoming data, from where the data is multiplied together and added with the value of the third register. The resultant value is stored back in the third register. The incoming data stored in the two registers is passed to the registers of the next cells (the top data propagates to the register of the downward cell while the left data propagates to the register of the rightward cell). The inputs from the left are connected to the 2 cells in the first column such that the first input is connected with the register of the first cell and the second input is connected with the register of the second cell. The top inputs are connected similarly with the cells of the first row. The values of the third register in each cell is sent as output.
