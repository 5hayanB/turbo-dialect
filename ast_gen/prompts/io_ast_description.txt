The "inputs" node contains input port nodes, incrementally named "in0, in1, in2, ...".
The "outputs" node contains output port nodes, incrementally named "out0, out1, out2, ...".
Each port node has two leaf nodes:
- "width" tells the bit width of the input and output ports.
- "name" holds the name of the port.
