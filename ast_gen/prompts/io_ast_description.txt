The "inputs" node contains input port nodes.
The "outputs" node contains output port nodes.
Each port node starts with the name of the port followed by an arrow along with the number of identical ports.
Each port node has a leaf node "width" which tells the bit-width of the input and output ports.
For example, left->4{width:4} means that there are four ports named "left" and all of them are 4-bits wide.
